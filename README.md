# Calling It Round

This repository is for _Calling It Round_, a CCCBR publication focused on getting ringers involved in calling and conducting from any bell.

_Calling It Round_ is aimed at an audience who is familiar with Plain Bob Minor and other common methods, but it doesn’t assume you’ve done any calling before. Examples are focused on various stages of Plain Bob as well as a few other common methods, with a few short touches of Grandsire included. It is my hope to add supplemental sections for Grandsire as well as Stedman and Erin in the coming months.

## Technical details

_Calling It Round_ is generated using Hugo, a static site generator.
