      <description>Basic Terminology #  English change ringing has a rich history spanning hundreds of years; it’s little wonder we’ve managed to create a language all our own. Calling It Round assumes you have a certain amount of knowledge about change ringing terminology already. “Look to” makes your ears perk up, you might have a favorite “method,” and you might already have rung a “quarter peal” (and if you haven’t already &amp;ndash; you know what it is!</description>

      <description>Finding Your Voice: Calling your first touch #  Now that you’ve got some terminology floating around your head, it’s time to start building up skills to help you learn to &amp;ldquo;find your voice&amp;rdquo; to call your first touch. Let’s put your knowledge to practical use and think about where and how to put the bobs in.
By the end of this section, you should be able to:
 Explain where, in a lead, the calls should go in; Listen to and “troubleshoot” a video of a caller who might have put some calls in the wrong places  In addition, you will be given some exercises to try out in your tower or with your handbell band.</description>

      <title>Simple Touches</title>

      <description>Simple Touches #  In this section, we’ll be covering some short and simple touches you can use for practice. This section will focus on touches that are short enough that it is practical to discuss which call is made at each lead, leaving discussions of “calling positions” (such as In, Wrong, or Make) for a later submodule.
Terminology #  Here we’ll be learning about calling using very simple compositions which are limited to a single method and a small number of calls.</description>

      <description>Demystifying “In, Out, Make”: The most common calling positions #  In this section, we’ll start to build the vocabulary and skills you’ll need to call longer and more complicated touches. When touches are longer than a few leads, it quickly becomes tiresome to memorize a long series of “plain, bob, bob, plain, bob, plain…”. To fix that problem, callers and conductors often use calling positions to help them remember where to put in the calls.</description>

      <description>Learning Short Touches #  In this section, we’ll put together everything we’ve covered over the course of Calling It Round so far by learning 2 different short touches that use the most common calling positions. In addition, I’ve compiled some collections of other short touches that use these calling positions as well; these collections will be included at the bottom as resources.

      <title>Less Common Calling Positions</title>

      <description>Less Common Calling Positions #  As we discussed in the previous section, you can do a lot with a little; knowing only a few calling positions can enable you to call a good number of touches. However, to unlock the rest of the huge treasure trove of compositions that exist, it’s necessary to know just a few more things. In this subsection, we’ll cover:
 A few more common calling positions (enough to get you through a majority of commonly-called compositions) A common touch, used for practices or Sunday services, that uses some of these new calling positions as well as some familiar ones.</description>

      <title>Learning Quarter-Length Compositions (or Longer)</title>

      <description>Learning Quarter-Length Compositions (or Longer) #  In this concluding section of the chapter on calling, we&amp;rsquo;ll be covering learning quarter-length or longer compositions. I debated for a long time whether to put this section in the Calling chapter or the Conducting chapter, because once you are calling longer compositions it is frequently very helpful to begin checking the ringing (conducting); however, it isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary and I know I certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t checking the ringing when I called my first quarter peal.</description>
