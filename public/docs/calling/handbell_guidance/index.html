<p>Much of the information in <em>Calling It Round</em> applies equally well to tower bell ringers and handbell ringers. However, there are some special tricks that are mostly suitable for handbell ringers that I think will be useful for you as you make a start at calling. Some of these tips may not be useful right away, and this will likely vary ringer to ringer; so take what&rsquo;s useful and leave the rest!</p>
<h2 id="use-both-your-bells">
  Use both your bells
  <a class="anchor" href="#use-both-your-bells">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you’re going to be ringing two bells while calling, they might as well both be useful to you. When you are starting, you are likely starting to call from either the trebles or the tenors. When you are ringing the trebles, you have the advantage of always knowing where the treble is (and therefore where to make the call!) somewhat “automatically,” which can be a huge advantage at first. Choosing compositions that can use the 2 as observation, then, will make your life quite a bit easier because you’ll be using “both your bells” and don’t have to necessarily rely on another ringer or another bell to keep yourself straight within the composition.</p>
<p>If you are ringing the tenors, you can also use both your bells. Even though the tenor is likely the observation bell, check in advance to see if there are any landmarks you can use with your other bell. For example, in the common touch WsWWsWHx3 for Plain Bob Minor, at each single it is the 5 making 3rds while the tenor dodges Wrong. In fact, in that touch, the 5-6 pair has a pattern that repeats every 2 courses!</p>
<h2 id="pick-handbell-friendly-compositions">
  Pick handbell-friendly compositions
  <a class="anchor" href="#pick-handbell-friendly-compositions">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There are a variety of compositions that are particularly composed for handbells. These have nice properties like leaving pairs of bells coursing, or having pairs of bells swapped over at part ends, or things like that. Even if you don’t know exactly what makes a composition “handbell-friendly,” using compositions that are marked that way is likely to be easier for your band and therefore less likely to cause a trip-up.</p>
<p>Don Morrison&rsquo;s website <a href="https://ringing.org/">ringing.org</a> has particularly good resources for handbell callers and conductors. Visit the relevant page and look for “handbells” within that page; many compositions are specially marked as being particularly suitable for handbells. As you study compositions of that type you should get an intuitive feel for some of the things that make a composition good for handbell ringers.</p>

<p>I highly recommend the book “Change-Ringing on Handbells Volume 1” by Tina Stoecklin and Simon Gay. They have many tips and tricks and go into much more detail than I have here.</p>
