  Submodule 1: Basic Terminology
  <a class="anchor" href="#submodule-1-basic-terminology">#</a>
</h1>
<p>English change ringing has a rich history spanning hundreds of years; it’s little wonder we’ve managed to create a language all our own. By this time in your ringing development, you will be familiar with quite a lot of ringing terminology. “Look to” makes your ears perk up, you might have a favorite “method,” and you might already have rung a “quarter peal” (and if you haven’t already &ndash; you know what it is!).</p>
<p>The purpose of this submodule is to introduce you to some basic terminology that is specific to calling and conducting. You may have heard some or all of these words before, but being aware of exact definitions can help you significantly as you progress. Investing early in cementing your knowledge of these terms will help you grow and learn quickly, as well as enabling you to have productive conversations with mentors and fellow learners of calling.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-a-caller-and-a-conductor">
  What’s the difference between: a caller and a conductor?
  <a class="anchor" href="#whats-the-difference-between-a-caller-and-a-conductor">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Caller:</strong> A caller puts in the calls but does not need to correct or track the ringing except to know when the calls go in. A caller may be one who just says “go” and “stop,” but it’s more common for people to think of callers as “bob-callers,” who put in the bobs (and singles, etc) and not just the “auxiliary calls” (go, stop, stand).</p>
<p><strong>Conductor:</strong> A conductor has the responsibilities of the caller, including keeping themselves right and putting the calls in the correct place. A conductor can also watch the others as they ring, at least part of the time, and the conductor has the “social mandate” to correct ringing issues, including striking issues. There are many ways of tracking and correcting ringing which will be discussed, but coursing orders are perhaps the most well-known (or at least most talked-about!). If you don’t know what ‘coursing orders’ means, don’t worry; it’ll be covered in a later module.</p>
<h2 id="what-sorts-of-things-do-callers-say">
  What sorts of things do callers say?
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-sorts-of-things-do-callers-say">#</a>
</h2>
<p>There are a variety of calls which can be thought of as “auxiliary calls,” in that they’re not needed in all ringing all the time (handbell ringers often skip them) and they happen “around” the method rather than “within” it. I think of these calls as including:</p>
<p><strong>Go, ____! (or, go next time, or variations)</strong></p>
<p><strong>That’s all (or, that will be all, or variations)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stand</strong></p>
<p>You will have heard these calls before and know what they mean.</p>
<p>Other calls happen within the method and affect how the method is rung by replacing one bit of the method with a different pattern. You will have been ringing touches and have doubtless heard of the most two common types of calls that happen within a method:</p>
<p><strong>Bob</strong>: Often means to make 14 places (not always true; e.g. in many compositions of Cornwall, bobs are 16). Often, but not always, compositions will specify if they are using bob to mean anything other than 14. As a general rule, take care to check what the calls are defined to mean if a composition includes a method that has plain hunt at the lead end rather than seconds, and take very special care if you are ringing spliced. Some surprise methods with plain hunt at the lead end still have 14 bobs by convention (Bristol) but others do not always (Cornwall).</p>
<p><strong>Single</strong>: Often means to make 1234 places (not always true; e.g. bobs in Single Court Bob Minor are often 1456). Often, but not always, compositions will specify if they are using single to mean anything other than 1456. As a general rule, take care to check what the calls are defined to mean if a composition includes a method that has plain hunt at the lead end rather than seconds.</p>
<p>There are a couple of other types of calls, some auxiliary and some not, which it is worth knowing about.</p>
<p><strong>Big bob and other non-standard calls …</strong>: You may hear these, though more rarely, and usually a caller or conductor will be very careful to tell the band beforehand if these are included!</p>
<p>“Big bob” is often used to disambiguate between types of bobs if there are, for example, both 14 and 16-type bobs in a composition. I remember first learning of “big bobs” in relation to surprise major one summer, and shortly thereafter being encouraged to take hold to try London Surprise Major for the first time at a tower whose practice night I was visiting. At this time, I was mainly used to ringing whole plain courses or half courses of surprise methods in tower. The London went surprisingly well (to my mind), but when the conductor called “Little Bob!” after a few leads I panicked &ndash; if bob is 14 and big bob is 16 then surely little bob must be 12?! &ndash; this, as it turned out, was the correct answer for the lead end change, but it did not help with the resulting lead of what was supposed to be Little Bob Major!</p>
<p>It’s likely that I won’t touch much more on non-standard calls in this work, but I wanted you to be aware of the different sorts of calls that can come up, especially if you are dealing with a non-standard touch length (e.g. in a date touch). You might hear about “extremes” or “hics” or other types of things; it’s always important to check if the composition has unusual calls, though most compositions do not.</p>
<p><strong>Call changes</strong>: Another, very important, type of calling which I will not be covering in this course!</p>
<p><strong>Go rounds</strong>: This is another type of auxiliary call that does not happen within the method as such. If the ringing has come to a tangle, or has simply lapsed in quality enough that you do not judge it fit to continue, you may call “Go rounds!” and the band will pull themselves into rounds.</p>
<h2 id="whats-the-difference-between-a-row-and-a-change">
  What’s the difference between: a row and a change?
  <a class="anchor" href="#whats-the-difference-between-a-row-and-a-change">#</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>Row:</strong> A row is something like 14235 or 81234567; it is an order in which the bells ring. It is colloquially called a <em>change</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Change:</strong> Strictly, it is the transition of one row to the next row (and according to the Framework, the rows must have the same stage). The place notation of a method describes its <em>changes</em> (abstract, about the transitions) rather than its <em>rows</em> (concrete, about the positions of the bells).</p>
<p>Throughout this work, I will try to say <em>row</em> when I mean <em>row</em>, and <em>change</em> otherwise, though I will likely slip up as the colloquial usage of <em>change</em> is so pervasive. I hope the correct meaning will be clear by context, but if not, feel free to contact me and I will make the relevant edit.</p>
<p>It is important to understand the distinctions above in order to understand the somewhat esoteric discussion we are about to have about the definition of a <strong>lead</strong>, a <strong>lead head</strong>, and a <strong>lead end</strong>, with which we will finish this section on basic terminology.</p>
<p>In the diagram here, you can see a lead (and a little) of Little Bob Minor. There is not wide agreement on <em>exactly</em> where a lead begins and ends, and <em>exactly</em> which changes are contained in a lead, though there are two common groups of thought (and many more groups of thought that are less common!).</p>
<p><strong>Camp 1:</strong> The lead head of this lead is rounds, and rounds is the first row in the lead. The last row in the lead is the row 165432, and therefore the lead is contained between two different times the treble is leading (the end of its lead, and the beginning of its next lead, inclusive). This interpretation is intuitive from a graphical perspective (starts when the treble is in 1, ends when the treble is in 1) and allows for the lead head and lead end both being included in the actual lead.</p>
<p><strong>Camp 2:</strong> The lead head of this lead is rounds, but rounds is <em>not</em> contained in the lead itself. Rather, the lead consists of all of the rows that result from the application of the changes of the method to the lead head. The last row in the lead is therefore 164523, which is also the lead head of the next lead. This interpretation is consistent with the <a href="https://cccbr.github.io/method_ringing_framework/classification.html">Framework for Method Ringing</a>, is consistent with the way many people think about splicing methods, and is also the interpretation that I favor. [A mathematical aside: under this interpretation of a lead, a method is a function from lead heads to a set of rows, the last row of which is also a lead head]</p>
<p>The distinction between these two camps is complicated by the common use of the term <strong>lead end</strong>. While it is generally agreed upon that the lead end row is technically the row containing the treble’s handstroke lead, the term “lead end” in common usage refers more often to either the <em>two</em> rows in the treble’s lead (in this case, 165432 and 164523) or to the lead end <em>change</em> itself, that is, the change that results in the transformation from the lead end row to the lead head row.</p>
<p>We will be talking a lot more about lead ends when we discuss where to put calls and how to read simple compositions, but I think that’s enough for now!</p>
