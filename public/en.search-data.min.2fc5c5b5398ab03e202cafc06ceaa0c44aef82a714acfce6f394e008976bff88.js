Calling It Round assumes you have a certain amount of knowledge about change ringing terminology already. For example, by this time in your ringing development, you will be familiar with quite a lot of ringing terminology. “Look to” makes your ears perk up, you might have a favorite “method,” and you might already have rung a “quarter peal” (and if you haven’t already \u0026ndash; you know what it is!).\nThe purpose of this submodule is to introduce you to some basic terminology that is specific to calling and conducting. You may have heard some or all of these words before, but being aware of exact definitions can help you significantly as you progress. Investing early in cementing your knowledge of these terms will help you grow and learn quickly, as well as enabling you to have productive conversations with mentors and fellow learners.\nWhat’s the difference between: a caller and a conductor? #  Caller: A caller puts in the calls but does not need to correct or track the ringing except to know when the calls go in. A caller may be one who just says “go” and “stop,” but it’s more common for people to think of callers as “bob-callers,” who put in the bobs (and singles, etc) and not just the “auxiliary calls” (go, stop, stand).\nConductor: A conductor has the responsibilities of the caller, including keeping themselves right and putting the calls in the correct place. A conductor can also watch the others as they ring, at least part of the time, and the conductor has the “social mandate” to correct ringing issues, including striking issues. There are many ways of tracking and correcting ringing which will be discussed, but coursing orders are perhaps the most well-known (or at least most talked-about!). If you don’t know what ‘coursing orders’ means, don’t worry; it’ll be covered in a later section.\nWhat sorts of things do callers say? #  There are a variety of calls which can be thought of as “auxiliary calls,” in that they’re not needed in all ringing all the time (handbell ringers often skip them) and they happen “around” the method rather than “within” it. I think of these calls as including:\n Go, ____! (or, go next time, or variations) That’s all (or, that will be all, or variations) Stand  You will have heard these calls before and know what they mean.\nOther calls happen within the method and affect how the method is rung by replacing one bit of the method with a different pattern. You will have been ringing touches and have doubtless heard of the most two common types of calls that happen within a method:\n  Bob: Often means to make 14 places (not always true; e.g. in many compositions of Cornwall Surprise Major, bobs are 16). Often, but not always, compositions will specify if they are using bob to mean anything other than 14. As a general rule, take care to check what the calls are defined to mean if a composition includes a method that has plain hunt at the lead end rather than seconds, and take very special care if you are ringing spliced. Some surprise methods with plain hunt at the lead end still have 14 bobs by convention (Bristol) but others do not always (Cornwall). You may hear 14 bobs referred to as \u0026ldquo;close\u0026rdquo; and 16 bobs (or 18 bobs in Royal, etc) referred to as \u0026ldquo;far\u0026rdquo;.\n  Single: Often means to make 1234 places (not always true; e.g. bobs in Single Court Bob Minor are often 1456). Often, but not always, compositions will specify if they are using single to mean anything other than 1234. As a general rule, take care to check what the calls are defined to mean if a composition includes a method that has plain hunt at the lead end rather than seconds. You may hear 1234 singles referred to as \u0026ldquo;close\u0026rdquo; and 1456 singles (or 1678, etc, on up the stages) referred to as \u0026ldquo;far\u0026rdquo;.\n  There are a couple of other types of calls, some auxiliary and some not, which are worth knowing about:\n Big bob and other non-standard calls …: You may hear these, though more rarely, and usually a caller or conductor will be very careful to tell the band beforehand if these are included!  “Big bob” is often used to disambiguate between types of bobs if there are, for example, both 14 and 16-type bobs in a composition. I remember first learning of “big bobs” in relation to Surprise Major one summer, and shortly thereafter being encouraged to take hold to try London Surprise Major for the first time at a tower whose practice night I was visiting. At this time, I was mainly used to ringing plain courses or half courses of surprise methods in tower. The London went surprisingly well (to my mind), but when the conductor called “Little Bob!” after a few leads I panicked \u0026ndash; if bob is 14 and big bob is 16 then surely little bob must be 12?! \u0026ndash; this, as it turned out, was the correct answer for the lead end change, but it did not help with the resulting lead of what was supposed to be Little Bob Major!\nIt’s likely that I won’t touch much more on non-standard calls in this work, but I wanted you to be aware of the different sorts of calls that can come up, especially if you are dealing with a non-standard touch length (e.g. in a date touch). You might hear about “extremes” or “hics” or other types of things; it’s always important to check if the composition has unusual calls, though most compositions do not.\n  Call changes: Another, very important, type of calling which I will not be covering in this course!\n  Go rounds: This is another type of auxiliary call that does not happen within the method as such. If the ringing has come to a tangle, or has simply lapsed in quality enough that you do not judge it fit to continue, you may call “Go rounds!” and the band will pull themselves into rounds.\n  What’s the difference between: a row and a change? #  We\u0026rsquo;ve talked broadly about different types of calls, but what those calls affect are the order of the bells within the method or principle. As such, it\u0026rsquo;s worth knowing some of the terms used when speaking about specific orders of bells. Two commonly-used terms are row and change.\nRow: A row is something like 14235 or 81234567; it is an order in which the bells ring. It is colloquially called a change.\nChange: Strictly, it is the transition of one row to the next row (and according to the CCCBR Framework for Method Ringing, the rows must have the same stage). The place notation of a method describes its changes (abstract, about the transitions) rather than its rows (concrete, about the positions of the bells).\nThroughout Calling It Round, I will try to say row when I mean row, and change otherwise, though I will likely slip up as the colloquial usage of change is so pervasive. I hope the correct meaning will be clear by context, but if not, feel free to contact me and I will make the relevant edit.\nLeads and lead ends #  It is important to understand the distinctions above in order to understand the somewhat esoteric, but hopefully useful, discussion we are about to have about the definition of a lead, a lead head, and a lead end, with which we will finish this section on basic terminology. It is useful to have these straight in your head as you are first learning how to read and interpret compositions, as often they are written out in a very condensed form. It is also useful to know the \u0026ldquo;anatomy of a lead\u0026rdquo; as you\u0026rsquo;re learning where exactly to put calls in.\nIn the diagram on the right, you can see a lead (and a little) of Little Bob Minor:\n There is not wide agreement on exactly where a lead begins and ends, and exactly which changes are contained in a lead, though there are two common groups of thought (and, I\u0026rsquo;m sure, other groups of thought that are less common!).\nCamp 1: The lead head of this lead is rounds, and rounds is the first row in the lead. The last row in the lead is the row 165432, and therefore the lead is contained between two different times the treble is leading (the end of its lead, and the beginning of its next lead, inclusive). This interpretation is intuitive from a graphical perspective (starts when the treble is in 1, ends when the treble is in 1) and allows for the lead head and lead end both being included in the actual lead.\nCamp 2: The lead head of this lead is rounds, but rounds is not contained in the lead itself. Rather, the lead consists of all of the rows that result from the application of the changes of the method to the lead head. The last row in the lead is therefore 164523, which is also the lead head of the next lead. This interpretation is consistent with the CCCBR Framework for Method Ringing, is consistent with the way many people think about splicing methods, and is also the interpretation that I favor. (A mathematical aside: under this interpretation of a lead, a method is a function from a lead head to a set of rows)\nThe distinction between these two camps is complicated by the common use of the term lead end. While it is generally agreed upon that the lead end row is technically the row containing the treble’s handstroke lead, the term “lead end” in common usage refers more often to either the two rows in the treble’s lead (in this case, 165432 and 164523) or to the lead end change itself, that is, the change that results in the transformation from the lead end row to the lead head row.\nWe will be talking a lot more about lead ends when we discuss where to put calls in and how to read simple compositions, but I think that’s enough for now!\nResources #   John Harrison\u0026rsquo;s Glossary of ringing terms CCCBR Framework for Method Ringing  Test Yourself! #  Try out this quiz to self-assess your grasp of the basics of bobs and singles, which will be assumed in Calling It Round.

Welcome to the start of Learning to Conduct, Part A. From here, we’ll start getting into the nitty-gritty of using and building upon the calling skills that you’ve already developed. By the end of this module, you will have learned about conducting quarter peals from around the circle, and about how to “put it right” without the use of coursing orders. So if you’re not quite sure what a coursing order is, but you’ve called a touch or two and want to learn more \u0026mdash; this is the place for you!\nAs we discussed in the previous module, you can do a lot with a little; knowing only a few calling positions can enable you to call a good number of touches. However, to unlock the rest of the huge treasure trove of compositions that exist, it’s necessary to know just a few more things to get started.

Let’s put your knowledge to practical use and think about where and how to put the bobs in.\nBy the end of this submodule, you should be able to:\n Explain where, in a lead, the calls should go in; Listen to and “troubleshoot” a video of a caller who might have put some calls in the wrong places  In addition, you will be given some exercises to try out in your tower or with your handbell band. These exercises are designed to help you “find your voice,” so that when it comes time to call a touch you have already gotten some practice talking while ringing.\nTerminology review #  Just a bit of a review from last time. You’ll remember that in the first submodule we reviewed the definition of a lead. There is not wide agreement on exactly where a lead begins and ends, and exactly which changes are contained in a lead, though there are two common groups of thought (and many more groups of thought that are less common!). The important thing to know is that there is a lead head and a lead end associated with each lead, and the term lead end may also refer to the change (not the row) at the end of the lead; in this case, it may be thought of as being an abbreviation of the term lead end change, though I think very few people consciously think of it as an abbreviation. Lead end may also refer to both rows at the end of the lead (in other words, it may refer also to the lead head of the following lead).\nHowever, in the ringing chamber, it is relatively unusual to hear the words lead head shouted (unless ringers are somewhat heatedly discussing a composition in advance of starting ringing!). As a general rule: If you’re thinking about composing, you will likely want to remember the exact distinction between lead heads and lead ends. If you’re thinking about conducting, likely you will ignore the fine distinctions and think about the more general, broad use of the term lead end to mean the last two rows in a lead and the change between them. As this publication has the teaching of calling and conducting as its primary aim, I will use the broad sense of lead end throughout, only referring to lead heads where it would otherwise be confusing to the reader.\nWhere to put the calls in #  There are a couple of different things that a caller needs to know how to say (and when to say!). It’s not all just bobs and singles! The caller is responsible for letting the band know when to stop ringing rounds and start ringing the method, and when to stop ringing the method and start ringing rounds. The caller is also responsible for telling the band when to stand after ringing is finished. In this section, I’ll break down the different types of calls and where in the lead the calls are typically made.\nThe diagram on the right shows, visually, where the calls might go in a short touch of Plain Bob Doubles. As with many aspects of ringing, there is no strictly correct place to make the calls, but we’ll cover some of the more common conventions.\n Go, next time! This call tells your band to stop ringing rounds and start ringing the method. Some people will exclusively say “Go, next time!” but others include the method name and would say something like “Go, Plain Bob Doubles!”. Either is fine. Using the latter convention is particularly helpful if there was any confusion about which method or stage was going to be rung before ringing started (e.g., if there was a kerfuffle over whether to ring minor or doubles). Others will choose to include different information such as “Go, next handstroke!” or “Go, Double Norwich at next backstroke!”, especially if there is an unusual start for a date touch or something. You can use your judgement and when in doubt, “Go, [method here]” is a safe bet.\nThe Go call is often made right before (or right as) the treble is leading at handstroke. Then the band has a handstroke and a backstroke to prepare to start moving around. However, on higher stages (or on heavier peals of bells), the call is often made a little later so as not to confuse the back bells, who are often finishing a backstroke as the treble starts the handstroke of the next row. I suggest watching what the other callers in your tower do, and see how it affects the start of the method. After a while watching, you’ll be able to get a sense for where to put this call to make it effective. When you go visiting, if you’re asked to call it’s wise to take a moment to think through how the differences in the bells may affect how you call. Louder bells or quieter voices, for example, may persuade you to make calls in the gaps between rows so that you can be heard sufficiently well.\nBob! or Single! This call tells your band that it’s time to change the pattern a little bit. In most methods, this call is made right before the row where the treble’s backstroke will be in 2; that is, a whole pull before the call will take effect. Sometimes the call can be made a little later. For example, a handbell caller may make the call in the middle of the row where the treble’s backstroke is in 2, since there is no need to give the heavy bells quite as much time to maneuver.\nThis will be all! or That’s all! This call (and variants thereof) tells your band to stop ringing the method and start ringing rounds again. This call has perhaps the most wiggle-room in terms of where to put it! If the touch is about to come round at a backstroke, some callers will say “That’s all!” right before the treble’s handstroke in 1 in the previous row, though this author typically makes the call later than that. Other callers will announce the coming rounds at the middle or end of the row where the treble’s handstroke was in 1. In other situations, especially if the touch is about to come round at handstroke, callers will announce “That’s all!” in the gap right before the bells come into rounds. In handbells, this call is not infrequently made as late as in the middle of the rounds themselves! When you are first learning to call, you are likely going to be calling a touch that comes round at backstroke. If you resolve to say “This will be all!” right before the treble’s handstroke in 1, even if you are a little late it will likely be fine.\nStand next or Stand This call lets the ringers know it’s time to set their bells. “Stand!” is often said at a similar point in the rounds to when “Go, next time!” is said, and for similar reasons; you need to give the back bells enough warning to prepare to set their bells, but not confuse anyone by calling it too early.\nTips for speaking clearly #  Speaking clearly and loudly enough is a must. If you’re uncertain about how loud to be, it’s better to err on the side of being too loud than too quiet to hear! Emphasizing the different numbers of syllables in “bob” and “single” can help ringers distinguish between the two even if they cannot hear you that well.\nCallers who are young or have higher-pitched voices may particularly struggle with being loud enough to be heard in the ringing chamber. In addition to the fact that many ringers are used to hearing low-pitched, adult voices give the calls, ringers that suffer from partial hearing loss will much more commonly have high-frequency hearing loss that affects their ability to hear higher-pitched voices. The solutions are to be as loud as you healthily can, to make calls during the handstroke gap wherever possible to reduce the noise of the bells during your calls, and to emphasize the consonants. If possible, you can also try to make eye contact with ringers who are Deaf or hard of hearing to make sure they can see your mouth move as you give the call.\nSummary #  Calls often go in a whole pull in advance, but there can be considerable variation depending on preference (and even region). The advice above holds for many common methods, like Plain Bob and various Surprise methods. Methods like Grandsire and principles like Stedman can operate somewhat differently, so if you’re called upon to call a touch of Grandsire or Stedman, make sure you are confident in knowing where the calls go in.\nExercises and Activities #  This section also comes with a variety of exercises that can be tried at home or with other ringers.\nWatch this #  Watch this touch of Plain Bob Doubles and then answer the questions.

Then, in ‘rounds order,’ everyone else says what they had for breakfast.

If it’s not possible to ask your Tower Captain/Ringing Master for speaking practice, there are some other things you can try:  Practice speaking while ringing handbells (alone or with a band) Practice making calls to a band over Zoom. These calls can be made while you are ringing with the virtual ringing software of your choice. Practice speaking while ringing on a simulator or a dumbbell.  This isn’t the ideal set-up: the simulated ringers either won’t listen or they’ll put in the calls themselves! Some software allows you to mute the call sounds, but almost all have a visual cue in addition to the sound cue.

This section will focus on touches that are short enough that it is practical to discuss which call is made at each lead, leaving discussions of “calling positions” (such as In, Wrong, or Make) for a later submodule.\nTerminology #  Here we’ll be learning about calling using very simple compositions which are limited to a single method and a small number of calls. A touch is simply the result of a composition being rung. Today we’ll discuss short touches, which are shorter than a quarter peal in length (less than 1250 changes), but our focus will be on very short touches that are easy to memorize and practice.\nSo, what makes a touch a touch, and why can’t you just call bob at random times while ringing and just enjoy the ride? Well, you can of course, but you risk violating one of several conventions that many people like to keep to when ringing:\n A touch should be true. Truth is defined rigorously by the Framework, but in common parlance a true touch does not repeat any row except that the last row is the same as the first. Some conductors are very good at improvising a composition which is true, while ringing, but to my knowledge very few start out that way \u0026mdash; so it’s easiest to keep to known compositions at the beginning. A touch should start and end with rounds. A touch will ideally avoid rows that end with 65 at backstroke (in minor) or 87 (in major), etc. Rows with 65s or 87s at back are thought to be unmusical.  Are the above guidelines set in stone? No, they are not, and people do sometimes ignore them for a variety of reasons. Some people don’t bother ensuring the truth or musicality of every practice night touch as long as it’s useful for some other pedagogical purpose. Starting a composition from a place other than rounds can also be a useful pedagogical tool. However, most of the time, most callers and conductors keep to true, musical compositions that start and end with rounds; so I’ll give you a few of those here to practice with.\nA first touch #  In my experience, it is traditional for a ringer’s first experience calling to happen as an immediate consequence of some tower captain saying something like: “Well, have you ever called a touch? I know a simple one of bob doubles, it’s just…”\nPerhaps you’ve had that experience and perhaps you haven’t; in any case, I wouldn’t want to deprive you.\nWell, have you ever called a touch? I know a simple one of bob doubles, it’s just 2 bobs in a row! Yes, that’s right, just catch hold of the treble there. Call a bob every time you pull your backstroke in two. (Here another ringer helpfully interjects: “But only do it twice! And when you get to rounds don’t forget to say that’s all!”). Ready? Go!\n For a first touch, I like to suggest that the ringer choose a method they (and ideally, everyone in their band) is comfortable with. For many bands, Plain Bob Doubles is a natural choice, so the first touch that we discuss here will be this simple (if not easy, for the first-timer!) touch of Plain Bob Doubles. Touches of other methods are given below if you are part of a band that prefers other methods.\nAs mentioned above, this first touch consists of two bobs, right in a row with one another. That is, when you get to the end of the first lead, you’ll say “bob”; at the end of that lead, you’ll say “bob” a second and final time; and the bells will pull into rounds at the backstroke of the treble’s lead.\nVery short touches are often notated this way:\n Plain Bob Doubles\n20 bb\n The method is given, the “20” shows how many rows there are in the composition (not counting the one that’s repeated), and each ‘b’ represents a lead with a \u0026ldquo;bob\u0026rdquo; called during the lead end.\nI really like this touch as a first touch, and let me tell you why.\n It’s easy to memorize It’s a method that is comfortable for many ringers It’s very short, so you definitely have time to try it again It’s a treat to ring from the treble. You don’t have to remember what to do at a bob while also calling a bob; you can practice just one thing at a time.  Compositions like this, where you make the call ‘bob’ at every lead, are called bob courses. A bob course can also be a touch that is the same length as the plain course, but has bob and plain leads in it. Many of the simple touches I’ll present below are bob courses!\nSeveral more short practice night touches #  These practice night touches were chosen for being short (so that they can be put in notation that is easy-to-read) and for being true in commonly-rung methods. For each touch in this table, I put the method, the number of rows, the composition, and some notes. Calling from the treble is appropriate for every touch; calling from an inside bell will be easier for some touches than others, and this fact is noted where appropriate.\nIn this table, ‘b’ is for ‘bob’; ‘s’ is for ‘single’; and ‘p’ is for ‘plain’ (no call). Spaces are not meaningful; they just chunk up the composition so patterns are easier to spot.\n   Method Length Composition Notes     Plain Bob Doubles 20 bb Called from the 2 or 3, you plain hunt the whole time.   Plain Bob Doubles 60 pb pb pb Called from the 4, you make every bob.   Plain Bob Minor 72 ppb ppb Called from the 4, you make every bob.   Cambridge Surprise Minor 120 bbbbb This one is deceptively tricky, but fun!   Kent Treble Bob Major 96 bbb Easiest from the treble or the back 4 bells. Often called \u0026ldquo;Three leads of Kent\u0026rdquo;.    This collection is a very cursory look at some simple touches, but there are many collections of touches using this notation that you can use as you begin to practice calling. I will cover other excellent resources for compositions such as CompLib or ringing.org at a later time. For now, I recommend the following sites for collections of simple touches:\n Cambridge District Touches and Compositions The Banners' Touches Collection  I’m sure there are other wonderful resources for touches using this notation out there; go forth and find! If you are the finder or creator of such a resource, please feel free to reach me and I will add it to this space.\nAside on notation: Note that the Banners' site contains touches in a very slightly different format. There, you read the calls off the left-hand column of the touch. A hyphen ‘-’ is a bob, an ‘s’ is a single, and a blank space indicates a plain. For example, here\u0026rsquo;s a 60 of Plain Bob Doubles from their site:\n Ignoring the numbers on the right-hand side, and focusing on just the left-hand annotations between the dashed lines, you can see a blank space (a plain) followed by a ‘-’ (bob), repeated twice to give “ - - -” or what we saw above as “pbpbpb”. Remember that the spaces in my table didn’t have meaning, they were just separators to show the pattern, so “pbpbpb” is the same as “pb pb pb”. The asterisk by the 60 indicates that the touch has been checked and is true. The authors also helpfully note some of the musical rows that turn up in the touch; here, Reverse Rounds (543216) and Kings (531246).\nExercises #  Try this #  Try calling the simple ‘bb’ touch of Plain Bob Doubles. You can either practice at your home tower or handbell practice, or online \u0026mdash; Ringing Room supports calling bobs, and can supply “robot ringers” that respond to you if you’d rather practice by yourself at first. If possible, ask an experienced caller or conductor to “shadow” the composition, or watch over the ringing while you are calling. They can help you if you get muddled, and give you advice afterwards on how to improve. And of course, if at first you don’t succeed: try, try again!\nWrite this #  This exercise is designed to help you work out the “bones” of a composition, including how to tell which bells will be “easier” or “harder” to call from.\nHere’s a composition of Plain Bob Minor: bbb. How many changes long is this touch (don’t forget: traditionally, we don’t include the repeated row of rounds in this total)? Write out the touch, including all of the rows. What do you notice about the path of the 2? The 3? Which bell makes each bob?\nCompose this #  You’ve seen a few simple touches \u0026mdash; and you are beginning to develop skills that will help you compose short touches yourself. These skills may be useful (or just fun to develop!) as you progress.\nThe composition ‘bb’ results in a true touch of Plain Bob Doubles. The composition ‘bbb’ results in a true touch of Plain Bob Minor. Can you write down a bobs-only, true composition for Plain Bob Triples? What about Major? Advanced: Write a sentence or two about the patterns you notice across all of these compositions. Which bells make the bobs? Which don’t?\nNote that in general, two examples do not a pattern make, and patterns are not always so obvious. But symmetry and patterns form a large part of the basis for composing, and are I think one of the most beautiful parts of ringing.\n"});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/docs/conducting_part_a/observation_bell/','title':"Conducting from the observation bell",'section':"Conducting Part A",'content':"Conducting from: the observation bell #  "});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/docs/conducting_part_a/treble/','title':"Conducting from the treble",'section':"Conducting Part A",'content':"Conducting from the treble #  "});index.add({'id':7,'href':'/docs/calling/demystifying_wrong_home_wrong/','title':"Demystifying \"In, Out, Make\"",'section':"Calling",'content':"Demystifying “In, Out, Make”: The most common calling positions #  In this section, we’ll start to build the vocabulary and skills you’ll need to call longer and more complicated touches. When touches are longer than a few leads, it quickly becomes tiresome to memorize a long series of “plain, bob, bob, plain, bob, plain…”. To fix that problem, callers and conductors often use calling positions to help them remember where to put in the calls. We’ll first define calling positions and then tell you about some of the most common ones. Knowing this vocabulary will give you access to a much bigger number of compositions! In the next submodule, we’ll get down to brass tacks learning new compositions using this new vocabulary.\nTerminology #  A plain course is a course of a method where there is no call at any lead end. However, callers and conductors often talk about courses which may or may not have calls in them. A course of this type starts when a tenor is in its home or natural position (in Plain Bob Minor, this is being in 6ths place at the backstroke of the lead end), and ends when the tenor has returned to its natural position. At some point, you have likely seen the plain course of a method written out like this:\n  credit: https://rsw.me.uk/blueline/methods/view/Plain_Bob_Minor\n  You’ll probably recognize this as Plain Bob Minor; there’s a treble (red line) plain hunting, and a bunch of other bells all dodging at the lead end (except one which is making seconds). Note that the tenor starts in 6ths place at the treble\u0026rsquo;s backstroke lead during rounds, and returns to 6ths place at the treble\u0026rsquo;s final backstroke lead in rounds.\nIn a tiny font off to the right hand side of each lead, you can see letters pointing to a particular place in the lead. These letters are shorthand for the names of various calling positions relative to a specific observation bell. Here, the observation bell is the tenor, in blue. An observation bell is a bell that you watch while you figure out where the calls go in a composition.\nA calling position is a position in the blue line (of the observation bell) where a call may be made.1 You can see that the hyphen next to the letter indicates the position in the row where the call would be made; it would then be executed at the treble’s lead. For convenience, many methods and principles have named calling positions. In the image above, five of these named calling positions are labelled: Wrong (W), Fourths (F), Before (B), In (I), and Home (H). In this section, I will always spell out the whole name, but give the common abbreviation in parentheses after. The calling positions in the diagram refer to the position that the observation bell (here, the tenor) would be in if a call were to be made. This fact can feel a bit unintuitive, because the plain course is written out such that there is a plain at every lead, but the calling positions refer to what would happen if a call were made. Let’s work our way through those calling positions with that in mind:\n   Calling Positions Abbr Definition (with tenor as observation bell)     Home H This calling position is the one where the tenor ends up at home (the 6th bell ending up in 6th place) at the lead end if a call is made.   In I This calling position is the one where the tenor would end up running in if a call were made.   Out (Sometimes: Before) O or B This calling position is the one where the tenor would end up running out if a call were made. It is sometimes known as “Before” because it happens when the tenor is coursing before the treble.   Make (Sometimes: Fourths) M2 or F If a call is made here, the tenor will make fourths.   Wrong3 W If a call is made here, the tenor winds up in 5ths at the backstroke of the lead end (by either dodging or hunting!). More generally, if a method is being rung on a stage with n bells, the calling position where the tenor ends up at position (n-1) is called Wrong (W). For example, in Plain Bob Major, if the tenor winds up in 7 after the call, the call was made at Wrong.    These calling positions \u0026mdash; Home (H), In (I), Out (O), Before (B), Make (M), Fourths (F), and Wrong (W) \u0026mdash; make up the majority of calling positions used in most compositions. Be aware that these named calling positions may change, unfortunately, from method to method (or principle), or from stage to stage. Worse, the abbreviations are not always unique; most important to be aware of is that (M) may mean either make (make fourths) or middle, which we haven’t discussed yet since it only comes up in higher stages.\nWith only 7 new words in your arsenal, you now have access to a huge number of compositions. For example, a great source of short touches is the Ringing World diary, of which a new edition is released each year; many compositions in the diary use only these calls, and the next submodule will introduce you to some of those compositions to help you get started.\nFrequently Asked Questions #  What does it mean if someone asks me to “call a Wrong”? #  This phrase is often shorthand for “call a bob at the calling position Wrong”. The phrase “call a single Wrong” most often means to call a single at the Wrong.\nWhen do I use Out vs Before? Or Make vs Fourths? #  Out and Before are two different names for the same calling position relative to the position of the observation bell; they both refer to a place in the lead where calling “bob” would lead to the observation bell running out. As a general (though not perfect) rule, methods that have a bell making seconds at the lead end use the names Before and Fourths, and methods that have plain hunt at the lead end use the names Out and Make. There are exceptions to this rule; for example, the calling positions in some doubles methods (including Plain Bob Doubles) are In, Out, and Make4 even though a bell makes seconds at the lead end. Always make sure to check you know what the calling positions mean for the method and composition you are using.\nHow does my understanding of calling positions change if the observation bell is not the tenor? #  As discussed above, an observation bell is the bell that you are watching (and perhaps ringing) to figure out where the calls go. In the diagram above, the tenor is the observation bell. Other bells can also serve as observation bells, but the calling position names remain the same. For example, if you are “ringing 4 as observation,” the call made at the position Home (H) will be made right before the 4 dodges into 6th place at the treble’s backstroke lead. This point is especially important to be aware of if you are hoping to call from a smaller bell.\nDoes this mean I can ring a composition from any bell as observation, not just the tenor? #  Yes and no. Some compositions are suitable to be rung with any bell as observation. However, most compositions are written with the tenor as observation, and often this is for good reason; the same composition with a different bell as observation may have undesirable musical qualities or other, bigger problems. If you’re planning on calling a composition in a different way to how it was set down by the composer, always check to make sure the resulting ringing will still be what you want it to be. In Conducting Part A, I will cover this topic in more detail.\nWhere do I go to learn more about calling positions? #  It is likely that there is at least one ringer in your local area who is happy to talk you through all your questions. However, there are other great resources to learn more:\n Steve Coleman’s The Bob Caller’s Companion Tina Stoecklin and Simon Gay’s Change Ringing on Handbells (handbell focus) John Harrison’s Glossary, especially for looking up the names or abbreviations of other calling positions  I’m sure there are many others.

Bearing in mind that the calling positions for Plain Bob Doubles are In, Out, Make, Home, can you translate that touch into notation that uses calling positions? Remember that most compositions assume that the heaviest working bell, here the 5, is the “observation bell” to which the calls pertain. (Hint, if you get stuck: Try writing out all the changes in the touch. Note what the 5 does at each lead. What would those calling positions be called?)\nConsider This #  Last submodule, we learned a simple lead-by-lead notation for calls. This time, we learned about calling positions (and next time, we’ll talk more about notation for compositions using calling positions). What are some pros and cons of using lead-by-lead notation instead of named calling positions? Which would you rather use to learn a very short touch? Which would you rather use to learn a quarter peal?\nNotes #    This is mostly true. It is not true for Stedman or Erin, but is true for the vast majority of other methods (and some principles); the work of the observation bell directly relates to the name of the calling position. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n There is another call known as \u0026ldquo;Middle\u0026rdquo; that we won\u0026rsquo;t cover in this section, but it can also be abbreviated with M.

Conducting is definitely a living tradition and it has changed over time; clearly nothing here is set in stone! But I am setting down what I believe to be common practice these days. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Technically, there’s also “Home” for when long fifths are made, but this is more often just thought of as being unaffected! \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/docs/conducting_part_a/nonobservation_working_bell/','title':"Conducting from a non-observation working bell",'section':"Conducting Part A",'content':"Conducting from a non-observation working bell #  Rotating the composition, picking a fixed bell that isn\u0026rsquo;t technically \u0026ldquo;observation,\u0026rdquo; watching the observation bell as hard mode\u0026hellip; some would argue just easier to look at coursing orders but\u0026hellip;\n"});index.add({'id':9,'href':'/docs/calling/reading_and_learning_compositions/','title':"Reading and Learning Short Touches",'section':"Calling",'content':"Reading and learning short touches using the most common calling positions #  In this section, we’ll put together everything we’ve covered over the course of Caling It Round by learning 2 different short touches that use the most common calling positions. In addition, I’ve compiled some collections of other short touches that use these calling positions as well; these collections will be included at the bottom as resources.\nWrong Home, Wrong Home #   The first touch we’ll go over is a great one for practice night; simple, with relatively few calls, and short enough for a second attempt if the first goes awry. When ringers talk about this touch, they will often call it “Wrong Home, Wrong Home” or, more rarely, “Wrong Home, repeat”. You can see on left-hand side that using calling positions here instead of calling it “bpppbbpppb” saves us a lot of space and a lot of remembering; we can just write out “WH WH” (or “WHx2”) instead and be done with it!\nA few words about how this composition is laid out: On the right-hand side, you can see a bunch of rows with the treble at the start and the other bells in different orders each time. The long horizontal lines split the rows into two courses, each of which ends with the tenor returning to its home position of 6ths place.\nThese rows themselves are the lead heads. To be explicit: These are the rows that are the backstroke lead of the treble. The left-hand side of the image shows whether there is a call or not, and at which calling position it is called. So you can see there is a bob at Wrong, a bob at Home, and then another bob at Wrong and another bob at Home. The hyphen \u0026ldquo;-\u0026rdquo; indicates that it is a bob, and the W or H indicates Wrong or Home. After the last home is called, the backstroke row will be 123456 \u0026mdash; rounds!\nIt is easiest to call this touch from the tenor, though it can be called from other bells. If you’re calling it from the tenor, then you can simply make a call every time you would be unaffected by that call; you make a call every time you dodge in 5-6, whether up or down. If you would like to know more about calling this touch from a lighter bell, there will be sections elsewhere on the Calling It Round site that discuss that; there are also a variety of resources in The Ringing World which I will link below. In brief: One option is to call the touch from a different bell but watch the tenor to figure out where to put the calls; another is to call whenever you dodge in 5-6 (up or down), regardless of the bell you’re ringing. It’s particularly musical from the 3 or 4, but perfectly acceptable to ring from any working bell.1 I recommend trying to call this touch from a variety of bells and seeing what you like to do best. Is it easier to see how the bells go if you call from one place or another? Do you prefer when there’s a call the first lead and the last lead, or if the calls are all towards the middle (as happens when you call from the 2 or 3)?\nTwo things to be careful of when you’re trying this touch for the first time, assuming you’re ringing the composition as laid out above:\n The first call (a bob at Wrong) is right after the first lead, so be on your toes! The second Wrong comes the lead straight after the first call at Home. So even though those two calls are in different courses, they feel awfully close together! I always recommend that when you’re first starting out, you look at the composition lead-by-lead to get a sense of where calls come in clusters. You might not necessarily have enough time to puzzle out that the Wrong is next in the heat of the moment; you might have to rely on your memory that the two calls come side-by-side.2  Three Homes #   The next (and final!) touch for this section is often called “Three Homes”. And it is what it says on the tin! See the left-hand side image for the composition. You can see there are three courses, with a call at Home in every course.\nIn Plain Bob Doubles, “Three Homes” gets you to 120 rows. That’s an extent! So you can link together 11 extents just like this one for a slightly repetitive but perfectly legitimate quarter peal of Plain Bob Doubles.3 It would be very good practice for “Three Homes,” that’s for sure.\nJust like “Wrong Home, Wrong Home”, Three Homes works for any bell. You can grab the 3 and call “bob” every time the 3 makes long fourths and you will ring a perfectly good extent! In fact, this feature \u0026ndash; that you can call Three Homes from any bell \u0026ndash; is one that is often used to make counting extents slightly less taxing. Once you’ve gotten a good amount of practice calling yourself as observation, you can begin to call extents while ringing just your bell and watching other bells to figure out where to put the calls in. If you call Three Homes for the 2, then the 3, then the 4, then the 5, you’ve called four extents. Repeat to get 8 extents, and then get the remaining 3 extents however you please; no counting to 11 required.\nYou can use “Three Homes” not only from different observation bells, but also for different methods entirely. Though the composition above uses Plain Bob Doubles, “Three Homes” is actually a composition that works in a great variety of methods. Bear in mind that “Home” can mean something slightly different for other methods \u0026mdash; in Plain Bob Doubles, it means make long 5ths, but in Plain Bob Minor it means dodge 5-6 down! You can also use “Three Homes” with a huge variety of methods, like Kent Treble Bob Minor or London Surprise Major, though you should also be aware that the Home may come in different places in the plain course in different methods. For these other methods, too, you can call from any bell; just be aware that there could be musical or other consequences! Whether you mind that or not is up to you.\n Both of the above touches and more are included in a complib collection, linked below:\n Short \u0026amp; Sweet: Touches of Plain Bob Collection  This collection was compiled for those working their way through Calling It Round. Once you’re there, you’ll find a list of compositions. You can click on any of the compositions to learn more. CompLib, which is a site built and maintained by Graham John, is an excellent resource, and if you are interested in learning more about calling and conducting, I strongly recommend availing yourself of it. It is well worth the time spent playing with all of the settings and figuring out what is most useful. For a starting caller, it is often very useful to click the composition and then the “Blue Line” section of the composition, so you can get a good sense of what all the bells do through the composition (and maybe remind yourself of where the calling positions come!)\nExercises #  Click this #  I really recommend creating an account and exploring around complib.org. Another resource I use very frequently is ringing.org, an excellent curated collection compiled and maintained by Don Morrison. I find that ringing.org is easier to navigate and has a more curated collection, whereas complib.org has more (and more complex) features but less curation. I use both frequently, though often for different things. For handbell ringers, I particularly recommend Don Morrison’s site as it frequently annotates which compositions are particularly suitable for handbells. You can simply navigate to a page of compositions and ctrl+F for “handbells” to see what I mean.\nRead This #  Want to know more about calling from a lighter bell?

However, there are some special tricks that are mostly suitable for handbell ringers that I think will be useful for you as you make a start at calling. Some of these tips may not be useful right away, and this will likely vary ringer to ringer; so take what\u0026rsquo;s useful and leave the rest!\nUse both your bells #  If you’re going to be ringing two bells while calling, they might as well both be useful to you. When you are starting, you are likely starting to call from either the trebles or the tenors. When you are ringing the trebles, you have the advantage of always knowing where the treble is (and therefore where to make the call!) somewhat “automatically,” which can be a huge advantage at first. Choosing compositions that can use the 2 as observation, then, will make your life quite a bit easier because you’ll be using “both your bells” and don’t have to necessarily rely on another ringer or another bell to keep yourself straight within the composition.\nIf you are ringing the tenors, you can also use both your bells. Even though the tenor is likely the observation bell, check in advance to see if there are any landmarks you can use with your other bell. For example, in the common touch WsWWsWHx3 for Plain Bob Minor, at each single it is the 5 making 3rds while the tenor dodges Wrong. In fact, in that touch, the 5-6 pair has a pattern that repeats every 2 courses!\nPick handbell-friendly compositions #  There are a variety of compositions that are particularly composed for handbells. These have nice properties like leaving pairs of bells coursing, or having pairs of bells swapped over at part ends, or things like that. Even if you don’t know exactly what makes a composition “handbell-friendly,” using compositions that are marked that way is likely to be easier for your band and therefore less likely to cause a trip-up.\nDon Morrison\u0026rsquo;s website ringing.org has particularly good resources for handbell callers and conductors. Visit the relevant page and look for “handbells” within that page; many compositions are specially marked as being particularly suitable for handbells. As you study compositions of that type you should get an intuitive feel for some of the things that make a composition good for handbell ringers.\nOther resources #  I highly recommend the book “Change-Ringing on Handbells Volume 1” by Tina Stoecklin and Simon Gay.
