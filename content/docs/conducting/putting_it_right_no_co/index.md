# Putting it right (without coursing orders)

social/physical clues about who is lost...

There are also strategies that you can use to conduct without the use of coursing orders. 

Structural/local conducting. Knowing the method well enough that you know where the landmarks are. Saying lead/half-lead, especially for surprise or little bob type things.

Just keeping an eye on the ringing the whole time, you will learn how to see when someone else misses the backstroke of the lead or sthg. this is something you can practice even when you're not conducting (perhaps even better to practice when you're not conducting...)
