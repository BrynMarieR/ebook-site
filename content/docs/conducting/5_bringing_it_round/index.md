# Bringing It Round

We've been through a lot of material together! This last section is just for compositions to get you good practice at "bringing it round," so to speak.

The skills and techniques you've learn can be applied to nearly any composition, including those from the chapter on Calling. However, it's sometimes useful to have access to a small list of compositions to choose from which are uniquely suited to one's needs. With that in mind, I've compiled a few compositions for each of the following categories. These tend towards the "easier" side, with a mind for being accessible to the learning conductor, but within that scope can vary in method or stage. There is always one composition of Plain Bob per category and at least one of Surprise or spliced Surprise; depending on the composition of your band different options might be more or less suitable.

## Traditional

## Particularly musical

## Ringing from a lighter bell

## Good for practice transposing coursing orders

## Handbell-friendly
