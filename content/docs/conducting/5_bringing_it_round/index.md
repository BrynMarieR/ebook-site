# Bringing It Round

We've been through a lot of material together! This last section is just for compositions to get you good practice at "bringing it round," so to speak.

## Composition collections

The skills and techniques you've learned can be applied to nearly any composition, including those from the chapter on Calling. However, it's sometimes useful to have access to a small list of compositions to choose from which are uniquely suited to one's needs. With that in mind, I've compiled a few compositions for you. There are two CompLib collections which I think you might enjoy:

1. [_Calling It Round: Good quarters for practice_](https://complib.org/collection/11083) is a collection that has 13 quarter compositions for Major methods. 
2. [_Mix and Match: Simple Quarter Peals of Minor_](https://complib.org/collection/10904) is a collection that does what it says on the tin! It has several 720s (extents of minor) and a few bits less than that to add up to make a quarter.

Both of these collections tend towards simple, commonly-rung quarter peals. Many have a very limited set of calling positions, and where possible only 3- or 4-bell coursing orders to keep track of. 

## Other resources

If you are interested in finding other compositions with which to practice, I can recommend the following online resources:

1. [Composition Library](complib.org), run by Graham John, has an extensive collection and a good search engine.
2. [ringing.org](ringing.org), run by Don Morrison, also has an extensive (though perhaps slightly more curated) collection all very well-organized under different headings and easy to browse through.

I almost always check both places when looking for a composition. 

As far as print resources, there are many good ones.

1. A favorite of mine is _The Ringing World Diary_, published each year by _The Ringing World_ with a very carefully curated selection of good touches, quarter peals, and peals. It can be purchased [here](https://www.ringingworld.co.uk/purchase/shop/diary.html).
2. There are also a variety of compilations by John Longridge, such as _Composition 500_ (for peals), _Quarter 500_ (for quarters), and _Standard 90_, which contains touches, quarter peals, and peals alike. John Longridge's books can be purchased through [the support website for his books](https://jnlrb.wordpress.com/).
3. There are also many collections available through the [Whiting Society](https://www.whitingsociety.org.uk/publications/publications.html) but I have not personally read any of the books in this collection.

The print resources, especially the older ones, may follow slightly different conventions than I have in _Calling It Round_; but variety is the spice of life and now it's up to you to figure out what you like best! There are also many other wonderful sources of compositions both on the internet and in print.
