**Caller:** A caller puts in the calls but does not need to correct or track the ringing except to know when the calls go in. A caller may be one who just says “go” and “stop,” but it’s more common for people to think of callers as “bob-callers,” who put in the bobs (and singles, etc) and not just the “auxiliary calls” (go, stop, stand). 

**Conductor:** A conductor has the responsibilities of the caller, including keeping themselves right and putting the calls in the correct place. A conductor can also watch the others as they ring, at least part of the time, and the conductor has the “social mandate” to correct ringing issues, including striking issues. There are many ways of tracking and correcting ringing which will be discussed, but coursing orders are perhaps the most well-known (or at least most talked-about!). If you don’t know what ‘coursing orders’ means, don’t worry; it’ll be covered in a later section.

So here we'll talk about tracking and checking the ringing, using information that you can get from the composition itself and doing some study beforehand.
