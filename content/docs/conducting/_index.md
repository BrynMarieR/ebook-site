# Conducting

Chapter 2, Conducting, focuses on more complex compositions and gives a variety of strategies for the beginning conductor to learn how to check and sometimes correct the ringing, with and without the use of coursing orders. There is a section dedicated to conducting from round the circle (not just the tenor!). It concludes with a few compositions designed to give good practice for the learning conductor.
