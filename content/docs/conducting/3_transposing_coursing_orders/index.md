# Transposing Coursing Orders

You might've felt a bit suspicious in the last section about my proposed use for coursing orders in conducting. I suggested that if you know the coursing order, you can watch how you pass the bells around you and thereby set people straight if you are passing them in an order that is not the correct coursing order.

In the plain course, knowing the coursing order is as easy as memorizing a short string of numbers, often in a very pleasing order (with such helpful mnemonics as "up the odds, down the evens!"). The trick is knowing the coursing orders when you're 7 calls in to a quarter of Plain Bob, nowhere near the plain course. 

One way to do this is by straight memorization, and doing some memorization of coursing orders at certain signposts (e.g. the halfway point, or a particularly tricky section) can be useful. The more flexible but definitely harder approach is to learn how to transpose[^1] the coursing orders _as you ring and call_, so you can keep a constant check on the ringing as you go.

## Calls and coursing orders

Let's talk about a few common calls and how those affect the coursing order. We'll use Plain Bob Minor again as our example, because there's only a small number of bells to keep track of.

### Wrong

Below is a picture of two lead of Plain Bob Major, starting in the plain course with a coursing order of 5324. There is a bob called at Wrong; what's the resulting coursing order? Use the convention of giving the coursing order relative to the 6, but with the 6 omitted. When you've finished, scroll down to read more.

{{< textbox id="tra1" answer="3254" >}}
{{< figure src="wrong_bob.png" class="float-right" width=200px >}}
{{< /textbox >}}

In the example given above, the coursing order changed from 5324 (the plain course coursing order) to 3254. Notice that the 4 stayed in the same place, but the other bells swapped position. In particular, they swapped like this:

### Home

{{< textbox id="tra2" answer="5243" >}}
{{< figure src="home_bob.png" class="float-right" width=200px >}}
{{< /textbox >}}

### Before

{{< textbox id="tra3" answer="5243" >}}
{{< figure src="before_bob.png" class="float-right" width=200px >}}
{{< /textbox >}}

### Single

{{< textbox id="tra4" answer="5243" >}}
{{< figure src="home_single.png" class="float-right" width=200px >}}
{{< /textbox >}}

## Other things to know

In minor, it is common to write the coursing orders as 4-bell coursing orders, such as 5324, because that covers all of the working bells except the heaviest one. In major, even though you add _two_ bells, it is common to write a 5-bell coursing order, omitting both the 7 and the 8. So for example, the "usual" coursing order of bells in Plain Bob Major would be commonly written as 53246. There is an implied 7 and 8 in there (I usually think of it as [7]53246[8] but others prefer to think of it as [87]53246 --- it's all preference). 

Calls at different calling positions may affect the way the transposition works. Calls at the same calling position in a different method may affect the transposition differently. This is one of those things where you must be careful to know what effect the calls in your composition have on the bells. It will be easiest to work up to it from a limited number of calling positions and relatively little number of bells (Minor or Major).

## Resources

### Print

If you are looking for a book full of other exercises on transposing coursing orders in a variety of methods, John Longridge's _Conducting & Coursing Order_ is the best one I know. He uses a slightly different convention where the Plain Hunt coursing order is given as 8753246 (but most of the time, omitting the 8 and 7, so it looks like what we have covered here: 53246).

## Notes

[^1]:
	If transpose isn't a familiar word to you, here's a definition: transpose means to change things around. It can have a more technical meaning if you're using it in mathematics, but that's the general meaning. Changing bells from the order 243 to 234 is a transposition.
