# Basic Terminology

English change ringing has a rich history spanning hundreds of years; it’s little wonder we’ve managed to create a language all our own. _Calling It Round_ assumes you have a certain amount of knowledge about change ringing terminology already. “Look to” makes your ears perk up, you might have a favorite “method,” and you might already have rung a “quarter peal” (and if you haven’t already -- you know what it is!). 

The purpose of this section is to introduce you to some basic terminology that is specific to calling and conducting. You may have heard some or all of these words before, but being aware of exact definitions can help you significantly as you progress. Investing early in cementing your knowledge of these terms will help you grow and learn quickly, as well as enabling you to have productive conversations with mentors and fellow learners.


## What’s the difference between: a caller and a conductor?

**Caller:** A caller puts in the calls but does not need to correct or track the ringing except to know when the calls go in. A caller may be one who just says “go” and “stop,” but it’s more common for people to think of callers as “bob-callers,” who put in the bobs (and singles, etc) and not just the “auxiliary calls” (go, stop, stand). 

**Conductor:** A conductor has all the responsibilities of the caller, including keeping themselves right and putting the calls in the correct place. A conductor can also watch the others as they ring, at least part of the time, and the conductor has the “social mandate” to correct ringing issues, including striking issues. There are many ways of tracking and correcting ringing which will be discussed, but coursing orders are perhaps the most well-known (or at least most talked about!). If you don’t know what ‘coursing orders’ means, don’t worry; it’ll be covered in a later section.


## What sorts of things do callers say?

There are a variety of calls which can be thought of as “auxiliary calls,” in that they’re not needed in all ringing all the time (handbell ringers often skip them) and they happen “around” the method rather than “within” it. I think of these calls as including:

* **Go, ____!** (or, go next time, or similar)
* **That’s all** (or, that will be all, or similar)
* **Stand**

You will have heard these calls before and know what they mean.

Other calls happen within the method and affect how the method is rung by replacing one bit of the method with a different pattern. You will have been ringing touches and have doubtless heard of the most two common types of calls that happen within a method:

* **Bob**: Often means to make 14 places (not always true; e.g. in many compositions of Cornwall Surprise Major, bobs are 16). Often, but not always, compositions will specify if they are using bob to mean anything other than 14. As a general rule, take care to check what the calls are defined to mean if a composition includes a method that has plain hunt at the lead end rather than seconds, and take very special care if you are ringing spliced. Some Surprise methods with plain hunt at the lead end still have 14 bobs by convention (Bristol) but others do not always (Cornwall). You may hear 14 bobs referred to as "near" and 16 bobs (or 18 bobs in Royal, etc) referred to as "far".

* **Single**: Often means to make 1234 places (not always true; e.g. bobs in Single Court Bob Minor are often 1456). Often, but not always, compositions will specify if they are using single to mean anything other than 1234. As a general rule, take care to check what the calls are defined to mean if a composition includes a method that has plain hunt at the lead end rather than seconds. You may hear 1234 singles referred to as "close" and 1456 singles (or 1678, etc, on up the stages) referred to as "far".

There are a couple of other types of calls, some auxiliary and some not, which are worth knowing about. It's also worth noting that I won't be covering any calls specific to call change ringing! 

* **Go rounds**: This is another type of auxiliary call that does not happen within the method as such. If the ringing has come to a tangle, or has simply lapsed in quality enough that you do not judge it fit to continue, you may call “Go rounds!” and the band will pull themselves into rounds. 

* **Big bob and other non-standard calls …**: You may hear these, though more rarely, and usually a caller or conductor will be very careful to tell the band beforehand if these are included! 

“Big bob” is often used to disambiguate between types of bobs if there are, for example, both 14 and 16-type bobs in a composition. I remember first learning of “big bobs” in relation to Surprise Major one summer, and shortly thereafter being encouraged to take hold to try London Surprise Major for the first time at a tower whose practice night I was visiting. At this time, I was mainly used to ringing plain courses or half courses of surprise methods in tower. The London went surprisingly well (to my mind), but when the conductor called “Little Bob!” after a few leads I panicked -- if bob is 14 and big bob is 16 then surely little bob must be 12?! -- this, as it turned out, was the correct answer for the lead end change, but it did not help with the resulting lead of what was supposed to be Little Bob Major! 

It’s likely that I won’t touch much more on non-standard calls in this work, but I wanted you to be aware of the different sorts of calls that can come up, especially if you are dealing with a non-standard touch length (e.g. in a date touch). You might hear about “extremes” or “hics” or other types of things; it’s always important to check if the composition has unusual calls, though most compositions do not.

## What’s the difference between: a row and a change? 

We've talked broadly about different types of calls, but what those calls affect are the order of the bells within the method or principle. As such, it's worth knowing some of the terms used when speaking about specific orders of bells. Two commonly-used terms are _row_ and _change_.

**Row:** A row is something like 14235 or 81234567; it is an order in which the bells ring. It is colloquially called a _change_. 

**Change:** Strictly, it is the transition of one row to the next row (and according to the [CCCBR Framework for Method Ringing](https://cccbr.github.io/method_ringing_framework/), the rows must have the same stage). The place notation of a method describes its _changes_ (abstract, about the transitions) rather than its _rows_ (concrete, about the positions of the bells).

Throughout _Calling It Round_, I will try to say _row_ when I mean _row_, and _change_ otherwise, though I will likely slip up as the colloquial usage of _change_ is so pervasive. I hope the correct meaning will be clear by context, but if not, feel free to contact me and I will make the relevant edit.

## Leads and lead ends

It is important to understand the distinctions above in order to understand the somewhat esoteric, but hopefully useful, discussion we are about to have about the definition of a **lead**, a **lead head**, and a **lead end**, with which we will finish this section on basic terminology. It is useful to have these straight in your head as you are first learning how to read and interpret compositions, as often they are written out in a very condensed form. It is also useful to know the "anatomy of a lead" as you're learning where exactly to put calls in.

In the diagram on the right, you can see a lead (and a little) of Little Bob Minor:

There is not wide agreement on _exactly_ where a lead begins and ends, and _exactly_ which changes are contained in a lead, though there are two common groups of thought (and, I'm sure, other groups of thought that are less common!).[^1] While it is generally agreed upon that the **lead end** row is technically the row containing the treble’s handstroke lead, the term “lead end” in common usage refers more often to either the _two_ rows in the treble’s lead (in this case, 165432 and 164523) and/or to the lead end _change_ itself, that is, the change that results in the transformation from the lead end row to the lead head row.

**Big picture**: In _Calling It Round_, I will use the term **lead end** in the common (but imprecise) usage to refer to the two rows of the treble's lead and the change between them.[^2] Sometimes, I will use the term **lead head**, which refers only to the backstroke row.

## Notes

[^1]: Here are the two main philosophical camps I see in popular use: 

	{{< figure src="leadend.png" alt="A lead of Little Bob Minor" class="float-right">}}

	**Camp 1:** The lead head of this lead is rounds, and rounds is the first row in the lead. The last row in the lead is the row 165432, and therefore the lead is contained between two different times the treble is leading (the end of its lead, and the beginning of its next lead, inclusive). This interpretation is intuitive from a graphical perspective (starts when the treble is in 1, ends when the treble is in 1) and allows for the lead head and lead end both being included in the actual lead.

	**Camp 2:** The lead head of this lead is rounds, but rounds is _not_ contained in the lead itself. Rather, the lead consists of all of the rows that result from the application of the changes of the method to the lead head. The last row in the lead is therefore 164523, which is also the lead head of the next lead. This interpretation is consistent with the [CCCBR Framework for Method Ringing](https://cccbr.github.io/method_ringing_framework/classification.html) and with the way many people think about splicing methods; it is also the interpretation that I personally favor. (A mathematical aside: under this interpretation of a lead, a method is a function from a lead head to a set of rows)

[^2]: Here's some of my reasoning for this decision, if you're curious. In the ringing chamber, it is relatively unusual to hear the words **lead head** shouted (unless ringers are somewhat heatedly discussing a composition in advance of starting ringing!). As a general rule: If one is thinking about composing, one will likely want to remember the exact distinction between lead heads and lead ends. If one is thinking about conducting, likely one will ignore the fine distinctions and think about the more general, broad use of the term **lead end** to mean the last two rows in a lead and the change between them. As this publication has the teaching of calling and conducting as its primary aim, I will use the broad sense of **lead end** throughout, only referring to lead heads where it would otherwise be confusing to the reader.
