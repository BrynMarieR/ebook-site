title: Learning Quarter-Length Compositions (or Longer)
---

You’ve made it! Welcome to the start of Learning to Conduct, Part A. From here, we’ll start getting into the nitty-gritty of using and building upon the calling skills that you’ve already developed. By the end of this chapter, you will have learned about conducting quarter peals from around the circle, and about how to “put it right” without the use of coursing orders. So if you’re not quite sure what a coursing order is, but you’ve called a touch or two and want to learn more --- this is the place for you!

# Reading and learning quarter-length compositions (or longer)

In the last chapter, we covered a number of common and less common calling positions, with an aim to give a greater repertoire for learning quarter peal length (or longer) compositions. Here, we'll be covering strategies for learning longer compositions with an eye for conducting them, not just calling them; that is, figuring out how to check the ringing as it's going along and possibly correct it as well.

Whether you've already called several quarters and a peal or whether you've just started calling touches at practice night, it's extremely useful to know the strategies that you can use to understand and "chunk up" longer compositions to make them easier to remember and conduct. So, to start of this chapter, we'll discuss a couple of the ways that I personally find useful when thinking about reading and learning longer compositions.  We'll start with how to read long-form compositions, using the most common notation, and then we'll cover strategies for learning them effectively for conducting purposes.

If you've had musical training, perhaps you've had to memorize a piece of music. The leap from reading from the sheet music --- with its orderly dots and lines --- to being able to recall complex passages from memory is, for many, a significant challenge. Even when starting very young, it can take years to build up the skills required to move from the passive intake of sheet music to the active, and ideally perfect, recalling from memory of a complex composition. 

Ringing is no different. Traditionally, ringers haven't used any form of visual aid for hundreds of years, and conductors haven't either. That means that you have to effectively memorize something that may be very complex, and act on that information while pulling a rope or ringing two handbells. However, the ability to memorize compositions, even long ones, is a learnable skill! It just takes building up slowly. 

Here we'll discuss some tips that you can use when you are first "learning to learn" compositions. Not everything works for everyone --- something that is extremely useful to one person might be ruinous to someone else --- but I hope by presenting a variety of techniques you might find one or two that are useful, or it might spark a brainstorm where you think of something new entirely!
