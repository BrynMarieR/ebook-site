# Submodule 5: Reading and learning short touches using the most common calling positions 

In this section, we’ll put together everything we’ve learned over the course of the module and learn 2 different short touches that use the most common calling positions. In addition, I’ve compiled some collections of other short touches that use these calling positions as well; these will be included at the bottom as resources.


## Wrong Home, Wrong Home

The first touch we’ll go over is a great one for practice night; simple, with relatively few calls, and short enough for a second attempt if the first goes awry. When ringers talk about this touch, they will often call it “Wrong Home, Wrong Home” or, more rarely, “Wrong Home, repeat”. You can see on left-hand side that using calling positions here instead of calling it “bpppbbpppb” saves us a lot of space and a lot of remembering; we can just write out “WH WH” (or “WHx2”) instead and be done with it!

It is easiest to call this touch from the tenor, though it can be called from other bells. If you’re calling it from the tenor, then you can simply make a call every time you would be unaffected by that call; you make a call every time you dodge in 5-6, whether up or down. If you would like to know more about calling this touch from a lighter bell, there will be submodules later in this series that discuss that; there are also a variety of resources in the Ringing World which I will link below. In brief: One option is to call the touch from a different bell but watch the tenor to figure out where to put the calls; another is to call whenever _you_ dodge in 5-6 (up or down), regardless of the bell you’re ringing. It’s particularly musical from the 3 or 4, but perfectly acceptable to ring from any working bell.[^1] I recommend trying to call this touch from a variety of bells and seeing what you like to do best. Is it easier to see how the bells go if you call from one place or another? Do you prefer when there’s a call the first lead and the last lead, or if the calls are all towards the middle (as happens when you call from the 2 or 3).

Two things to be careful of when you’re trying this touch for the first time, assuming you’re ringing and watching the tenor:



1. The first call (a bob at Wrong) is right after the first lead, so be on your toes! 
2. The second Wrong comes the lead straight after the first call at Home. So even though those two calls are in different _courses_, they feel awfully close together! I always recommend that when you’re first starting out, you look at the composition lead-by-lead to get a sense of where calls come in clusters. You might not necessarily have enough time to puzzle out that the Wrong is next in the heat of the moment; you might have to rely on your memory that the two calls come side-by-side.[^2]

## Three Homes

The next (and final!) touch for this section is often called “Three Homes”. And it is what it says on the tin! See the left-hand side image for the composition. You can see there are three courses, with a call at Home in every course. 

In Plain Bob Doubles, “Three Homes” gets you to 120 rows. That’s an extent! So you can link together 11 extents just like this one for a slightly repetitive but perfectly legitimate quarter peal of Plain Bob Doubles.[^3] It would be very good practice for “Three Homes,” that’s for sure.

Just like “Wrong Home, Wrong Home”, Three Homes works for any bell. You can grab the 3 and call “bob” every time the 3 makes long fourths and you will ring a perfectly good extent! In fact, this feature -- that you can call Three Homes from any bell -- is one that is often used to make counting extents slightly less taxing. Once you’ve gotten a good amount of practice calling yourself as observation, you can begin to call extents watching other bells. If you call Three Homes for the 2, then the 3, then the 4, then the 5, you’ve called four extents. Do that twice and then call another 2 and a half extents and you’re finished with the quarter peal, and no counting to 10.5 required.

You can use “Three Homes” not only from different observation bells, but also for different methods entirely. Though the composition above uses Plain Bob Doubles, “Three Homes” is actually a composition that works in a great variety of methods. Bear in mind that “Home” can mean something slightly different for other methods --- in Plain Bob Doubles, it means make long 5ths, but in Plain Bob Minor it means dodge 5-6 down! You can also use “Three Homes” with more exotic methods, like London Surprise Major. For these other methods, too, you can call from any bell; just be aware that there could be musical consequences! Whether you mind that or not is up to you.

Both of the above touches and more are included in the complib.org collection, linked below. Just click to access. Once you’re there, you’ll find a list of compositions. You can click on any of the compositions to learn more. If you are interested in learning more about calling and conducting, I strongly recommend availing yourself of this excellent resource, built and maintained by Graham John. It is well-worth the time spent playing with all of the settings and figuring out what is most useful. For a starting caller, it is often very useful to click the composition and then the “Blue Line” section of the composition, so you can get a good sense of what all the bells do through the composition (and maybe remind yourself of where the calling positions come!)

I really recommend creating an account and exploring around [complib.org](https://complib.org/). Another resource I use very frequently is [ringing.org](https://ringing.org/), an excellent curated collection compiled and maintained by Don Morrison. I find that [ringing.org](https://ringing.org/) is easier to navigate and has a more curated collection, whereas [complib.org](https://complib.org/) has more (and more complex) features but less curation. I use both frequently, though often for different things. For handbell ringers, I particularly recommend Don Morrison’s site as it frequently annotates which compositions are particularly suitable for handbells. You can simply navigate to a page of compositions and ctrl+F for “handbells” to see what I mean.

## Notes

[^1]:
     Be warned that this strategy will not work out as nicely for all compositions; you may end up with undesirable musical qualities like 65s at back.

[^2]:

     These combination calls are some of the most treacherous territory for any conductor. A lot is changing, all at once, and it can be all-too-easy to lose your concentration (and the coursing order, or the part end, or…) amidst the chaos. So give yourself as many sign-posts as you can!

[^3]:
     Technically, you only need 10.5 extents of Plain Bob Doubles to make a quarter peal. However, you’d have to use a different composition for the half extent. :)
