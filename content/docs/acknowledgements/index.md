# Final Words

I'm happy to say that there is a lot more content about calling and conducting than I could possibly write for _Calling It Round_. One of the biggest joys of ringing, for me, is the possibility of constant growth and learning; and there's so much more to learn about conducting than the meagre amount I've managed to set down here. My hope is that this site was helpful in giving you grounding in some basics, giving you context for some common conventions, and giving you a reason to go practice!

I can only hope it was half as enjoyable and educational for you to browse this website as it was for me to make it. 

# Sources

I have tried to acknowledge my sources throughout. However, I want to make special mention of the sites from which I got many images. In all cases, the source of the image is linked from the image itself (if I didn't create the image myself). However, I just want to make special mention of those websites that I used throughout, namely:

- [CompLib](complib.org)
- [Blueline](https://rsw.me.uk/blueline/methods/)
- [TheBanners](https://www.thebanners.uk/touches/)

I would like to thank their creators for their hard work and encourage readers to visit.

# Special Thanks

Special thanks are due to the people who helped bring this to life: Simon Linford, David Smith, and Leland Kusmer. They provided invaluable feedback throughout the process.
