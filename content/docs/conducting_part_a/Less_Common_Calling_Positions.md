You’ve made it! Welcome to the start of Learning to Conduct, Part A. From here, we’ll start getting into the nitty-gritty of using and building upon the calling skills that you’ve already developed. By the end of this module, you will have learned about conducting quarter peals from around the circle, and about how to “put it right” without the use of coursing orders. So if you’re not quite sure what a coursing order is, but you’ve called a touch or two and want to learn more --- this is the place for you!

As we discussed in the previous module, you can do a lot with a little; knowing only a few calling positions can enable you to call a good number of touches. However, to unlock the rest of the huge treasure trove of compositions that exist, it’s necessary to know just a few more things to get started. In this submodule, we’ll cover:



1. A few more common calling positions (enough to get you through a majority of commonly-called compositions)
2. A few resources you can use to teach yourself more calling positions, when it becomes relevant.

Why did we learn this particular set of calling positions?
