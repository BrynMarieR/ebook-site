# Supplemental Skills

Chapter 3, Supplemental Skills, gives a few extra items of guidance that might be thought of as auxiliary to the conducting itself, but which I think are useful. For example, there is a section with advice on picking a good handbell composition, and another on thoughts about placing a band for a touch or quarter peal.

To navigate to a subsection within this section, use the left-hand side navigation bar. You may need to click on the menu bar (three stacked horizontal lines) in the top left to access if you are on a small screen.
