# Welcome 

Welcome to _Calling It Round_, an online publication focussed on getting ringers involved in calling and conducting from any bell.

This online publication will be aimed at an audience who is familiar with Plain Bob Minor and other common methods, with an emphasis on laying an even groundwork of terminology from the beginning. _Calling It Round_ doesn't assume you've done _any_ calling before.

## Overview

Section 1, Calling, covers the basics required to call one's first touch, and to learn simple compositions independently. It also includes a supplementary section with calling advice for those ringing handbells.

Section 2, Conducting Part A, focusses on more complex compositions and gives a variety of strategies for the beginning conductor to learn how to check and sometimes correct the ringing, without the use of coursing orders.

Section 3, Conducting Part B, covers the fundamentals of coursing orders, and how to use them in checking and correcting the ringing.

Section 4, Supplemental Skills, gives a few extra items of guidance that might be thought of auxiliary to the conducting itself, but which I think are useful pieces of advice. For example, there is a subsection with advice on picking a good handbell composition, and another on how to set yourself up for success when placing a band for a touch or quarter peal.

While each section has its own unique focus, all of the sections will include content aimed at helping the aspiring caller or conductor to learn how to use their new skills _round_ the circle; that is, not just from the tenor.

Although I tried to give as much information as I thought expedient (and not more!), but doubtless personal tastes will vary. I hope everything I have included is correct; please let me know if it is not. 

## About the Author

I am an early-career conductor in the Boston, Massachusetts area. I learned to ring in late 2017 and called my first quarter a year later; and that was that! Since then, I've conducted a modest complement of quarters and peals, and a good number of practice night touches. Many of those have been called from a lighter bell, and through _Calling It Round_ I hope to encourage those who prefer to ring lighter bells to give calling a try!

## About the Publication

I can't claim to be a preeminent expert on conducting, but I _have_ trod the path of the beginning conductor very recently and remember what it was like trying to cobble together all of this advice from various sources, whether in the pub, through a book, or online. This publication therefore represents a collection of wisdom I've received and found useful, or tricks I've thought of and want to share. It's by no means a comprehensive resource, but I hope it is a useful jumping-off-point for those who are interested.
